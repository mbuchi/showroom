// Identical handler to `api/signal-collect.ts`. This exists only so the once
// per session flush of queued usage signals does not put a row literally named
// "signal-collect" in the browser Network tab. See
// aireon-shared/docs/SIGNAL_STANDARD.md for what that does and does not buy:
// it reduces incidental visibility, it is not a privacy or security property,
// and it is trivially findable by anyone who looks.
//
// `api/signal-collect.ts` stays forever: stale cached bundles still post there.
